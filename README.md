## BDD
 1. Create a mental picture about what the webpage is supposed to look like and its functioning.
(a) The 'What we do'  icons when clicked should toggle between the respective description of each icon. The description should be centered aligned. The header should be in bold and centered also.
(b) A hover effect for the 'Portfolio' sections such that on hover a white box appears with then name of the project inside. The project picture should still be visible in the background.
(c) Make the site responsive.
(d) Tell the user through a pop up that you have received their message and also thank them for contacting you.
(e) Use mail chimp API to track all the emails and messages from your users
 2. Create necessary folders and files, write HTML basic structure and fill in the content, write functions on JavaScript file while formulating IDs for the functions in the HTML page, style using bootstrap and CSS.
 3. Keep making improvements on the website.
